So, I've been running Netrunner Rolling for a couple days now, and I have to say that I like it. I switched out KDE's window manager for Awesome, and it's working very nicely. The preinstalled stuff they include with KDE makes setting everything up very easy, since all the stuff I would normally install (and some things that I probably wouldn't but are still nice to have) is already there, along with codecs and a bunch of other nice things. Also, being back in an Arch environment is very nice. It feels a lot lighter than my Fedora install. I get much better battery life, along with a faster boot time (which I'm looking to cut down even further, for competitive reasons).

As far as Awesome goes, it's, well, awesome. The tray is very nicely integrated and as a whole, it's very customizable. Although all the guides I keep finding are out of date, since they keep changing things around. But even that's surmountable, if I take a little time to get the hang of setting everything up. I'm currently looking into having a Conky HUD for monitoring RAM and CPU usage, along with an elegant shutdown dialog and some programs I'd like to autostart every time I log in.

Anyway, I'll be posting more in the coming days, once I'm a little less busy with school and getting ready for the hackathon this Friday (which I'll definitely have to make a post and a repo for).
