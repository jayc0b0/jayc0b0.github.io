Well, it's certainly been a while since I made a post here. Things have definitely been interesting these last several months. I moved back in with my parents, lost my job (Well, more like got cut down to zero hours) because of a lack of income for the business, and dealt with depression, among other things. But there's been some good things in life as well. I passed a difficult math course, got into all the classes I needed for the semester, started working through The Odin Project on my own time, began learning Japanese, and generally started to really dig into self-improvement in earnest.

So, what's the game plan now? Well, I'm currently applying to a bunch of internships and bootcamps. As I mentioned before, I'm learning web development on my own time. And my savings, despite being meager, have lasted me a while with some light work to keep the money flowing. Now to just get some work and hope that those internships work out, because I would absolutely love to do something awesome this summer. As for this blog, I'm currently working on cleaning up the absolutely amateurish HTML I slapped together months ago, as well as making this site look a lot nicer. Additionally, I'm going to make it a goal of mine to write at least a post a week. I need to build my brand and it's not going to be built with me sitting around. So, here's to leaping ahead on this leap year day and here's to hoping things start picking up even more steam as time goes on.
