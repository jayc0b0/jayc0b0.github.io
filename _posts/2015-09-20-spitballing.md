So I've been thinking about AMP, the programmers meetup I'm trying to get off the ground, and so far, I think I've got a pretty good idea of what I want to do. I'm thinking that a typical meeting will be from 3 to 4 hours, with at least an hour or so committed to working through some programming problems together or solo. I'm leaning towards being language agnostic versus making the meeting for a particular language or paradigm. I mean, it may make things a little more difficult if someone comes in with a language that nobody else knows, but I don't want to get stuck in a rut of having everyone working through problems with just one language, since even if you end up with multiple solutions to the problem, you'll likely end up with the issue of everything looking like a nail when all you have is a hammer. Which is to say that I'd like to be exposed to the different ideas and paradigms that different languages bring to the table.

As far as other things go, I'll definitely leave some time for people to talk and meet one another and discuss projects and collaboration. I mean, what good is a meetup without the "meet" of the whole thing? (Woop, and there's a pun. I swear I didn't mean to make it.) Anyway, getting back on track, I firmly believe that getting people talking and sharing will really help to spread ideas and get people to network with one another. It sucks knowing there's all these people taking CS classes in the area, but not really _knowing_ any of them, aside from a few. I want to help people make friends, find partners, and foster friendly competition. It's great to have that sense of camaraderie and competition pushing you along. I've certainly experienced it with JD as my roommate (although he's certainly my senior in a lot of ways). Because even if your friendly rival is a ways ahead of you, you still get that motivation to catch up to them or learn a thing or two.

Anyway, I guess I'd better get to the "meat" of this meetup. (Damn it, there I go again. I swear, I can't control this stuff. It just happens.) Here's a rough layout of how I want to do things:

<p><em>* Socializing while waiting for people to show up</em></p>
<p><em>* Diving into some programming problems</em></p>
<p><em>* Possible discussion topic</em></p>
<p><em>* General talking and collaborating until people leave</em></p>

So yeah... Pretty simple I guess. Now to see if I can get this to work in practice.
