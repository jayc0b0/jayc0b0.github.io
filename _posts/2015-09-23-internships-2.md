So I had my second interview in three days today. This one was for the other company I applied to. I feel like it went pretty well, even though I might have flubbed a question or two. (They were asking for semi-specific life experiences and it took me a minute to think of something in my own life that would match what they were asking for.) Other than that, I feel like the interview as a whole went well. I was able to demonstrate some technical knowledge (explained git and git repos and how Github fits into the whole thing to the lead intern/IT guy there) as well as "good self-assessment" (the interviewer's own words).

Other than that, I haven't done much today, aside from working on some things for my classes and drinking coffee and eating good food at Empresso. (My Java and Networking classes were cancelled. Just one of the perks of having one professor teaching both of your in person CS classes.) I'll check in later with some updates on how things go. I'm getting to the point where I might end up with a real problem on my hands regarding where I choose to work. (On one hand, there's the more conservative, buttoned down place that's sort of established already and that I could definitely make some waves at. On the other, there's the more flexible one where I'd be getting mentored, but I don't know what it may lead to, since it's a new enterprise. And I've done good at both places regarding interviews so far. Ugh. Good problem to have. Not any easier to decide.)
