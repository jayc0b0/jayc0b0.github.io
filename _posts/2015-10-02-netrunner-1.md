So, I decided to hop back into Arch Linux. However, I got softened up from my forays into Debian and Fedora, so I ended up going with one of the more user friendly ones, and went with Netrunner Rolling (The stable releases are based on Kubuntu), which is pretty awesome so far. It took a little setting up, since the rolling release's live cd is sort of old (they're releasing an updated one pretty soon). But now that I've worked through the frustration, it's nice to be running on something based off of Manjaro. The repos are pretty complete, and using pacman again feels very nostalgic, since Arch was my first distro (I'm crazy, I know). I'll be posting periodic updates on how my foray back into Arch Land goes.
