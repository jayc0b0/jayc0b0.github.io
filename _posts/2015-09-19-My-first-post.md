It took me a while to get around to doing this, but I finally decided to go ahead and bite the bullet, since I just got Fedora all up and running on my new T410. I new some HTML beforehand, so it wasn't too hard to follow along with the tutorial I found. (Thanks to Jonathan McGlone and his post [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)). Anyway, I've just got to finish out the tutorial by setting up a page to collect these posts and maybe do a little bit of customization or some programming problems.
