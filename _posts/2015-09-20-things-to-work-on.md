Things are going pretty good as far as setting up this blog. I decided to hop on late last night (Early this morning? What does 3 AM qualify as? Eh, whatever. The dark time when I should have been sleeping.) to add a couple of things to the blog. I got an RSS feed working, added pagination, and told Jekyll to auto-generate a sitemap. I've still got plenty of things that remain to be done though. For one, this blog is either bog-standard and dull, or butt-ugly and in need of a makeover, depending on how nice you want to be. So that's sort of up there on the priority list. Next up is adding my resume on its own page, so people who visit my blog can take a look. (And maybe be interested in me, but that's sort of getting ahead of ourselves, isn't it?)

So, in no particular order, here's what I need to do for this blog in the relatively close future:

# The Grand List of THINGS TO DO:
1. <strike>Ensure the Sitemap is functional</strike>
2. <strike>Add a resume page</strike>
3. Make things look better (the blog as it stands _is_ pretty ugly)
4. Keep up on posting here. Talk about things I'm working on, developments in my life, etc...
5. Get people to read this
