So I got sick this weekend. And man, you never realize how awesome being healthy is until you're sick and hating every minute of it. I thought I was fine going into this weekend. The sore throat I'd been dealing with went away and I felt fine for a day. But then I got super clogged sinuses and I felt like my head wasn't attached to the rest of my body. Luckily, I was well taken care of. But still, being sick is pretty awful, especially when you have things you need to do. Maybe it's for the best though. I really should take a bit more time to rest up.
