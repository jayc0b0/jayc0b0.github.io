So I had an interview for one of the internships I applied for today. I felt a little nervous going in, but I guess my resume and cover letter were impressive to the person reading applications and conducting interviews. She said that she liked what she saw, and in addition, the interview as a whole went pretty good. I've got one more interview to go for this internship and I'm hoping it goes well. I really like what they're offering (mentorship and the potential for further employment) and I feel like getting in will really give me a boost, in education, experience, and in employability. 

As for the other one, I'm feeling pretty good about it. Honestly, I really just want to get out there and do some good work and get some good experience in the field. For the longest time I didn't feel anywhere close to being ready to do any real work, but now I feel fairly confident in my abilities. I feel like I can actually learn some things and do some awesome work along the way, so here's to the future of this endeavor. Let's hope it's a start to something great.
