    <hl>About me...</hl>
    <p>I'm a second year Computer Science student, currently trying to learn everything I can about everything that interests me.</p> 
    <hl>My current focuses are as follows:</hl>
    <p><em>* Java</em></p>
    <p><em>* C++</em></p>
    <p><em>* Learning Agile development skills</em></p>
    <p><em>* Android App Development</em></p>
    <p><em>* Growing the numbers of my local programmers meetup (AMateur Programmers of Stockton, or AMP)</em></p>
    <p><em>* Becoming a l33t haxx0r in Linux</em></p>
    <p><em>* Finding some work in the field</em></p>
    <p></p>
    <hl>Some of my other skills include:</hl>
    <p><em>* Python</em></p>
    <p><em>* Basic Networking (Although I am working toward a Network+ certification)</em></p>
    <p><em>* Windows Installation and Troubleshooting (Being the "tech guy" for everyone around you your whole life really pays off ;) )</em></p>
    <p><em>* Project management</em></p>
    <p></p>
    <hl>My other interests include:</hl>
